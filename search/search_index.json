It uses carrier-sensing to defer transmission until no other stations are transmitting. This is used in combination with collision detection in which a transmitting station detects collisions by sensing transmissions from other stations while it is transmitting a Frame . When this collision condition is detected, the station stops transmitting that frame, transmits a jam signal, and then waits for a random time interval before trying to resend the frame.

A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses MAC addresses to forward data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI Model . Some switches can also forward data at the network layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches . Switches for Ethernet are the most common form of network switch. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch Take advantage of MAC addresses to allow devices to communicate directly. At first a switch acts like a hub, forwarding all frames to all devices, but quickly creates a source address table (SAT) and only forwards to destination MAC addresses. Each device connection can run at full network speed. Unicast messages always go only to the intended recipient. All broadcast messages go to all ports except origin port.

In the early days of switches a frame could get caught in a loop and bring the network down. STP uses special frames called BPDUs to communicate with other switches BPDU: Bridge Protocol Data Unit Configuration BPDUs elect one switch as root bridge to act as center of STP. There can be redundant links for fault tolerance but certain ports will be placed in a blocking state and will not send/receive frames.

The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms which are based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions . Effective security requires keeping the private key private; and the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. Source Description # Symmetric-key encryption has one serious weakness: anyone who gets a hold of the key can encrypt or decrypt data with it.

The hash is irreversible. You can't re-create the original data from the hash even with knowing the hash algorithm and the checksum.

Operating systems and applications use hashes to store passwords. It's not a good idea to store passwords in plaintext. The OS or application just hashes the password provided and compares the hash to the stored hash. If they match the password is correct.

Modes are the possible solutions of the Helmholtz equation for waves, which is obtained by combining Maxwell's equations and the boundary conditions. These modes define the way the wave travels through space, i.e. how the wave is distributed in space. Waves can have the same mode but have different frequencies. This is the case in single-mode fibers, where we can have waves with different frequencies, but of the same mode, which means that they are distributed in space the same way, and that gives us a single ray of light. Although the ray travels parallel to the length of the fiber, it is often called Transverse mode since its electromagnetic oscillations occur perpendicular (transverse) to the length of the fiber.

For block ciphers , the use of an IV is described by the modes of operation.

Many modern linux distributions contain either Vi or Vim. Often Vim, which stands for vi improved will be symbolically linked (or aliased) to vi on Linux systems. Most if not all of what's in this tutorial is interchangeable between Vi or Vim. Vi was first written in 1976 by Bill Joy at the University of California at berkley. vim was written by and is still maintained by Bram Moolenaar. Why Learn Vi/Vim? # Vi is almost always available on Linux systems. If you're ssh'd into a server and you don't have the ability (or the authority...) to install additional software packages, vi will almost always be available by default. You may not always have access to a graphical CLI editor like nano. Vi is lightweight and fast. Vi is designed for typing speed and efficiency. There's a learning curve, but once over that hurdle you may find yourself wondering why all user interfaces where you edit text don't have a vi mode. You want other Linux nerds to respect you and you're irrationally concerned with being judged by based on your bash history. Basics # Starting vi (vim): $ vi $ # Or ... $ vim You should see something like the following in your terminal: 1 ~ ~ VIM - Vi IMproved ~ ~ version 8.2.3182 ~ by Bram Moolenaar et al. ~ Modified by <bugzilla@redhat.com> ~ vim is open source and freely distributable ~ ~ Become a registered Vim user! ~ type :help register<Enter> for information ~ ~ type :q<Enter> to exit ~ type :help<Enter> or <F1> for on-line help ~ type :help version8<Enter> for version info ~ ~ ~ To exit vi (vim) type :q then press Enter . :q This should return you to the shell prompt. If for some reason this doesn't work we can force the issue with: (this can sometimes happen if we've made a change to the file that hasn't been written yet.) :q! Tip: if you get lost in vi/vim try pressing the Esc key twice. You can create a new file with vi by passing a filename that doesn't exist as an argument: $ vi foo.txt Or you may open a file that already exists with vi by providing the file as an argument: $ vi /path/to/somefile.txt Editing Modes # Vi is a modal editor. When vi starts it's in command mode. In this mode almost everything is a command. Be careful what you type in this mode, you may end up executing commands you didn't intend. Entering Insert Mode # After you've opened or created a file that you're trying to edit, in order to add some text you need to enter insert mode. To do this press the i key. You should see the following at the bottom of the screen: -- insert -- Try typing some text: the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. To exit insert mode and return to command mode, press the Esc key. Saving Your Work # To save changes to your file enter an ex command while in command mode. You can do this by typing : . You should see a colon character appear at the bottom of your terminal. : To write our modified file, type a w and then press Enter. :w The file will be written to disk. You should get a confirmation message at the bottom of your terminal that looks similar to this: \"foo.txt\" [new] 1l, 46c written Tip: the vim documentation confusingly calls command mode normal mode and that ex commands are called command mode. Moving Around the Buffer # While in command mode, vi offers a large amount of movement commands. Many of these are shared with the less pager. In fact many Linux utilities have some type of vi mode. Once you learn these, this skill is farily portable. Cursor movement keys key Moves The Cursor l or right arrow Right one character h or left arrow Left one character j or down arrow Down one line k or up arrow Up one line 0 (zero) Beginning of the current line ^ First non-whitespace character on the current line $ End of the current line w Beginning of the next word or punctuation character W Beginning of the next word, ignoring punctuation characters b Beginning of the previous word or punctuation character B Beginning of the previous word, ignoring punctuation characters Ctrl-f or Page Down Down one page Ctrl-b or Page Up Up one page #G To line #. For example, 12G moves to the 12th line of the file G To the last line of the file gg To the first line of the file When vi was originally written not all video terminals had arrow keys and commonly the letters h , j , k , and l were used. Many commands in vi can be prefixed with a number. We can specify the number of times a command will be executed. For example, 5j will move the cursor down 5 lines. Basic Editing # In general editing text consists of basic operations like inserting text, deleting text, moving text around by cutting and pasting, etc. Vi supports all of this and more. Vi also provides undo if you press u while in command mode. This undo's the last change you made and will come in handy while you practice some basic text editing in Vi. Appending and Inserting Text # To append text after the cursor press a and then type the text that you with to add. Try moving the cursor to the end of the line in your text file and appending some text. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was cool. Type Esc to get out of insert mode after you've finished inserting your text. Instead of moving to the end of the line and typing a in order to append text. You can type A and this will automatically put you at the end of the line and in insert mode. Similarly lowercase i allows you to enter insert mode before the cursor, but capital I puts you in insert mode at the beginning of the line. As you grow more familiar with the variety of Vi commands at your disposal you'll learn that for most things that you would want to do, there's often a short-cut available like this. Opening a Line # We can also insert a line above or below the current line and enter insert mode. To do this type o to insert a line below the current one and type O to insert a line above the one your cursor is currently on. For example: Line above. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was cool. Line below. Again to exit insert mode just type Esc . Deleting text # Vi offers a variety of ways to delete text. To delete the character underneath the cursor type x . You may preceed x with a number to delete that many characters. The d command is more general purpose. d is followed by a movement command that controls the size of the deletion. To delete the current line type dd . You can preceed d with a number like x , to execute a delete command that many times. Text Deletion Commands Command Deletes x Current character #x # of characters dd Current line #dd # of lines dW From current cursor position to beginning of next word d$ From current cursor position to end of line d0 From current cursor position to beginning of line d^ From current cursor position to first non-whitespace character dG From current line to end of file d#G From current line to # line of file If you make a mistake, you can undo a deletion with the u command. Note: Real vi supports only a single level of undo. Vim supports multiple levels of undo. Cutting, Copying, and Pasting Text # The d command not only deletes text but it also \"cuts\" text. Anytime you use the d command it will save that snippet of text into a paste buffer that can later be used. To paste text use the p command to paste the contents after the cursor or the P command to paste the contents before the cursor. The y command is used to \"yank\" (copy) text to the paste buffer.

Feel free to practice adding, deleting, yanking and pasting text into your text file. Remember, you can always undo with u . Search-and-Replace # In vi you can search a single line or a whole file. You can also perform text replacements as in a search-replace , also known as a substitution . Searching Within a Line # The f command searches a line and moves the cursor to the next instance of a specified character. For example fa would move the cursor to the next occurrence of the character a . After performing a character search the search may be repeated by typing ; . Searching the Entire File # To search for a word or phrase the / command is used. After typing / type a string to search for and press Enter . This will move the cursor to next occurrence of that string in the file. You can repeat the search forward through the file by pressing n . You can perform the search backwards through the file by pressing N . Vi's search function allows for the use of Regular Expressions, but that is outside of the scope of this tutorial. Feel free to type :help in command mode to refer to vim's help docs. Global Search-and-Replace # The basic syntax for searching a whole file and replacing every occurrence of a string is: :%s/search/replace/g If we break this down... : starts an ex command. % specifies the range of lines for the operation, in this case % is a shortcut that means from the 1st line to the last line in the file (aka the whole file). s specifies the operation we're performing which in this case is a substitution . /search/replace/ specifies the search text and the replacement text. Those of you who are familiar with sed might notice the similarity between how vi performs substitutions and how sed does. The g means \"global\" which will replace every occurrence of the search string that's found with the replacement string. Vi can also ask for confirmation for every substitution if we add the confirmation command to our search-replace. :%s/line/Line/gc Before each substitution you will be prompted with: replace with Line (y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y)? yes, no, all, quit, last, Ctrl-e (scroll up), Ctrl-y (scroll down) Resources # Vimtutor # There's actually a tutorial built right into Vim that is highly recommended. The above introduction is just that, an introduction. There's quite a bit more that you can do with vim and which is unfortunately ouside of the scope of this article. If you're learning vim, running vimtutor from your terminal or :help tutor from inside of vim will open the tutorial that's builtin to the editor. This covers much of what's in the tutorial above as well as quite a bit that wasn't able to be covered here. There's the added benefit of being able to practice your vim skills right inside of vim. One suggestion is to work through the vimtutor once per day for a week or so for about 20 minutes each time and restarting the tutor each time you complete it. Practice and repetition is a good way to solidify your skills and commit many of the keyboard commands and skills to memory. After a week of practice you'll be well on your way to becoming proficient in Vim. Other Resources # As always there's the official help docs which ship with vim if you run :help from any vim buffer.

If you're ssh'd into a server and you don't have the ability (or the authority...) to install additional software packages, vi will almost always be available by default. You may not always have access to a graphical CLI editor like nano. Vi is lightweight and fast. Vi is designed for typing speed and efficiency. There's a learning curve, but once over that hurdle you may find yourself wondering why all user interfaces where you edit text don't have a vi mode.

Traumatic bonding # Wikipedia - Traumatic bonding Parent-child relationships # Abuse and/or neglect # The children of dismissive caregivers or cruel/harsh caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e. intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus, focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive. [15] [8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver. Neurophysiological outcomes # The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurobiological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more. [4] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that the establishment of a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life. [29] ``Psychological abuse is correlated to sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety, and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened. [30] Adverse mental health outcomes # Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. As a result of the abuse itself and of their emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop a self-image that is incredibly negative. \"[C]ontrolling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating\" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse. [5] Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim, and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later on in life. [9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an \"affectionless control\" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life. [9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression , bipolar disorder , mania , suicidality , and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong. Fuck...

Since it's difficult to always know if you're repeating yourself when you create a file-name, it's probably best practice to use a unique string as the ID. neuron solves this by making the string a random 8 char string. Org-roam uses date + time down the second and prefixed to the file-name. I like this method because it's still unique with the string of date/time numbers but also still has the title of the file in the ID. It makes fuzzy finding files a bit easier.

Vimwiki for example. Plugins should do one thing and do it well. This was the inspiration behind why that author created wiki.vim. Vimwiki tries to take control of things like markdown syntax highlighting and folding. And it's just not that good at it when it comes down to it. Vimwiki doesn't handle markdown very well. It's like the forgotten step-child of the Vimwiki project. Vimwiki is probably really nice using Vimwiki syntax. But who needs another syntax to learn when there's Markdown. And Vimwiki just isn't portable anywhere else. The purpose built vim-markdown plugin is much better at this. If you want software running in an OS, use emacs . The philosophy of vim is do to do one thing and do it well. Resist the urge to add all kinds of plugins. Be choosy about the plugins you add. And use plugins that are well-documented and still seem to be actively developed. Use plugins that do one thing well. Don't add plugins to add additional features that is available in native vim or in those plugins you already have that do one things well. For example, notational-fzf-vim uses FZF to find and created new articles. But all of this can already be handled by FZF _ fzf.vim. The author of FZF wrote fzf.vim so it's really nice. And both FZF and fzf.vim are well documented. There's no reason to have notational-fzf-vim on top of that. And notational adds errors or issues that are difficult to troubleshoot without good docs. If you don't do this be willing to address the added complexity you've introduced into your editor. If you love troubleshooting problems with your editor rather than getting any work done, then feel free to ignore sensible restraint.","title":"Plugin Philosophy"},{"location":"20210905100839-automotive/","text":"Tire Sizes TPMS","title":"Automotive"},{"location":"20210905101059-programming/","text":"Languages # Bash Python Lisp Clojure JavaScript Lua Paradigms # Imperative Functional Syntax # Code Linting Machine Learning # Physics-based Deep Learning Misc. # Art of problem solving: Hammock Driven Development 20220623214742-cool-dev-shit The real cost of context switching","title":"Programming"},{"location":"20210905101059-programming/#languages","text":"Bash Python Lisp Clojure JavaScript Lua","title":"Languages"},{"location":"20210905101059-programming/#paradigms","text":"Imperative Functional","title":"Paradigms"},{"location":"20210905101059-programming/#syntax","text":"Code Linting","title":"Syntax"},{"location":"20210905101059-programming/#machine-learning","text":"Physics-based Deep Learning","title":"Machine Learning"},{"location":"20210905101059-programming/#misc","text":"Art of problem solving: Hammock Driven Development 20220623214742-cool-dev-shit The real cost of context switching","title":"Misc."},{"location":"20210905101447-text-editors/","text":"Vim # Vi Vim Emacs # Emacs","title":"Text Editors"},{"location":"20210905101447-text-editors/#vim","text":"Vi Vim","title":"Vim"},{"location":"20210905101447-text-editors/#emacs","text":"Emacs","title":"Emacs"},{"location":"20210905101559-markup/","text":"HTML CSS Markdown","title":"Markup"},{"location":"20210905101924-database/","text":"Data RDBMS","title":"Database"},{"location":"20210905101950-sustainability/","text":"Green Energy","title":"Sustainability"},{"location":"20210905103534-hugo/","text":"Resources # Docs Writing notes with Vimwiki and Hugo static generator Themes # Simple and \"just works\" docs theme * hugo-book Blogging # Deploying My Blog","title":"Hugo"},{"location":"20210905103534-hugo/#resources","text":"Docs Writing notes with Vimwiki and Hugo static generator","title":"Resources"},{"location":"20210905103534-hugo/#themes","text":"Simple and \"just works\" docs theme * hugo-book","title":"Themes"},{"location":"20210905103534-hugo/#blogging","text":"Deploying My Blog","title":"Blogging"},{"location":"20210905103617-writing-notes-with-vimwiki-and-hugo-static-generator/","text":"","title":"Writing Notes With Vimwiki And Hugo Static Generator"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/","text":"Security # CompTIA Security+ # Books # CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-701 Professor Messer SY0-601 Security+ Course Notes Professor Messor SY0-701 Security+ Course Notes Exam Objectives # CompTIA SY0-601 Exam Objectives CompTIA SY0-701 Exam Objectives Video Courses # Professor Messer's CompTIA SY0-701 Security+ Training Course Videos # MIT's Missing Semester - Security and Cryptography Notes # 20220321163659-root-pw-rotation","title":"Security"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#security","text":"","title":"Security"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#comptia-security","text":"","title":"CompTIA Security+"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#books","text":"CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-701 Professor Messer SY0-601 Security+ Course Notes Professor Messor SY0-701 Security+ Course Notes","title":"Books"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#exam-objectives","text":"CompTIA SY0-601 Exam Objectives CompTIA SY0-701 Exam Objectives","title":"Exam Objectives"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#video-courses","text":"Professor Messer's CompTIA SY0-701 Security+ Training Course","title":"Video Courses"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#videos","text":"MIT's Missing Semester - Security and Cryptography","title":"Videos"},{"location":"20210905104155-security/#notes","text":"20220321163659-root-pw-rotation","title":"Notes"},{"location":"20210905133206-deploying-my-second-brain/","text":"Navigate to docroot for dev site Right now that's ~/Public/notes.alexkraker.net Build site hugo Copy public directory to my server: rsync -azvP -e 'ssh -p 36' \\ /home/akraker/public/second-brain/public/ \\ alexkr@server.alexkraker.net:~/notes.alexkraker.net That's it!

For example, in the line containing Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/user1/domain.com/*.conf\" , this is the include path for domain.com which is owned by user1. Many of the lines are commented out, but if you place a .conf file in that path and rebuild Apache, the line containing that path will be uncommented automatically. The reason we double check the path is because some servers use /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2/ and /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2/ instead. Note: The folder for an addon domain will go by the name of the Virtual Host which will match the subdomain tied to that addon when it's created in cPanel. The path under ssl/ is for HTTPS and the path under std/ is for HTTP. I recommend placing the proxy under the ssl path, and then forcing HTTPS in the std path or .htaccess file. Making Reverse Proxy Configuration Changes for a Domain # Create the folders that match the appropriate include path for the domain you're working with, similar to below. mkdir -p /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/cpuser2/subdomain.domain2.com/ Now create a file in that path with the text editor of your choosing and place the proxy directives within that file. vim /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/cpuser2/subdomain.domain2.com/proxy.conf A very simple reverse proxy configuration will look something like this, with 10000 being the port number of the application you wish to serve. ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" Set up Redirect for HTTPS # Finally, we will force HTTPS in the .htaccess file within the document root of that domain. vim /home/cpuser2/subdomain.domain2.com/.htaccess Place the following contents in the file. RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301] Alternatively, you could place that in an include file such as /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/cpuser2/subdomain.domain2.com/ssl.conf At the time of writing this, it isn't a common practice for Managed Hosting, but if you would like to do a kindness for our Customer Success department, leave a comment in the domain's .htaccess file to let them know about the configuration changes and where they are located. This could save the customer and the agent time in diagnosing a website issue that is out of scope for Support/APS. ## This domain has rewrites to force HTTPS and a reverse proxy to port 10000 configured by Managed Hosting. ## The configuration for this setup is found in the files below: ## /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2/cpuser2/subdomain.domain2.com/ssl.conf ## /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2/cpuser2/subdomain.domain2.com/proxy.conf Apply the configuration changes # Rebuild and restart Apache to apply the changes above. /scripts/rebuildhttpdconf && /scripts/restartsrv_httpd Then test the domain to see if the proxy worked. As long as the application does not limit external access, you can try comparing the domain with the application as it appears when accessing the service directly via the port number. IE Using the examples above, we would visit http://server.hostname.com:10000 and compare with subdomain.domain2.com. Common Issues # When navigating to other pages on the site, 404 errors occur. First, check how the site appears on the application behind the proxy in case this is a development related issue. Then, check the URL that you are directed to or the 404 error itself if it provides the path to the resource not found. Is there an extra trailing slash in the path/URL? It's possible you may need to remove the trailing slash at the end of the path and/or localhost URL in the proxy. It depends on how the paths are configured in the application itself. For example, you may start with the following config. ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" If you change it to what you see below, you might find the application works. ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000\" Alternatively, if you started with what you see below and have difficulties ProxyPass \"/app/\" \"http://localhost:10000/app1/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/app/\" \"http://localhost:10000/app1/\" You may want to try removing the trailing slashes like so. ProxyPass \"/app\" \"http://localhost:10000/app1\" ProxyPassReverse \"/app\" \"http://localhost:10000/app1\" When accessing the application through the proxy, items cannot get added to the cart, and the user cannot log in despite there being no message indicating authentication failure. It's possible you need to add additional directives to the proxy configuration to ensure that the cookies on the site are functioning properly. This problem is common when the path on URL behind the proxy differs from the path on the external URL. Here is an example. ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/subdir/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/subdir/\" Let's say this configuration was added for the virtual host somedomain.com. If this site uses cookies, internally the URL to that cookie will be something like localhost:10000/subdir/my-cookie, but externally the URL should be somedomain.com/my-cookie. The relative path to the cookie might still be considered subdir/my-cookie, so the request for the cookie when we access somedomain.com in a browser ends up being somedomain.com/subdir/my-cookie, which does not exit. Here's the solution to establish the appropriate paths and domain for cookies which was lost in translation going through the proxy. ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/subdir/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/subdir/\" ProxyPassReverseCookiePath /subdir / ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain localhost somedomain.com It's possible you may need to place a trailing slash in the directives for ProxyPassReverseCookiePath to get things working. As mentioned in a previous section, it seems to depend how the application is coded. Additional Configuration # Location Blocks # Sometimes the ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives are container in Location blocks similar to what you see below. <Location \"/\"> ProxyPass \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"http://localhost:10000/\" </Location> As you can see, when contained within a Location block, these directives take only one argument, because the first is aready specified in the tags. Official Apache documentation recommends that you do not mix the two contexts. If there are proxy directives in Location blocks already, then any additional proxy settings should be contained within its own appropriate location block. In reverse, if there is existing configuration within a virtual host containing proxy pass directives that are not contained within Location blocks, then additional proxy pass directives should be added in the same fashion. This is acceptable. <Location \"/\"> ProxyPass \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"http://localhost:10000/\" </Location> <Location \"/subdir/\"> ProxyPass \"http://localhost:10000/subdir/\" ProxyPassReverse \"http://localhost:10000/subdir/\" </Location> This is also acceptable. ProxyPass \"/subdir/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/subdir/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" Something like this will potentially cause confusion, and official Apache documentation discourages it. ProxyPass \"/subdir/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/subdir/\" \"http://localhost:10000/\" <Location \"/\"> ProxyPass \"http://localhost:10000/\" ProxyPassReverse \"http://localhost:10000/\" </Location> Loading order # You might run into a set up where the URLs in multiple proxy configuration overlap. For example, I might want https://mydomain.com to load an application at http://localhost:10000/mystore but I also want https://mydomain.com/blog to load an application at http://localhost:10000/blog . This can cause conflict potentially because the URL mydomain.com/blog is a subdirectory of mydomain.com/ which has a proxy set up for a different app. Fortunately, if you place the ProxyPass directives in the correct order, this shouldn't cause issues. The order changes, however, depending on if you are using Location blocks or not. Loading Order - No Location Block # For proxy rules that are not contained within a location block, you want the longest path/URL first. So in the example above, your configuration file would look like this. ProxyPass \"/blog/\" \"http://localhost:10000/blog/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/blog/\" \"http://localhost:10000/blog/\" ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/mystore/\" ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:10000/mystore/\" Loading Order - Location Block # For proxy rules that are contained within location blocks, you will need to start with the shorter path/URL. In the example above, your configuration file would look like this if you're using location blocks. <Location \"/\"> ProxyPass \"http://localhost:10000/mystore/\" ProxyPassReverse \"http://localhost:10000/mystore/\" </Location> <Location \"/blog/\"> ProxyPass \"http://localhost:10000/blog/\" ProxyPassReverse \"http://localhost:10000/blog/\" </Location>","title":"Apache Reverse Proxy Setup"},{"location":"20210909083255-apache-reverse-proxy-setup/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"20210909083255-apache-reverse-proxy-setup/#resources","text":"Apache Mod Proxy cPanel - Apache Vhosts Tomcat Proxies","title":"Resources"},{"location":"20210909083255-apache-reverse-proxy-setup/#process","text":"","title":"Process"},{"location":"20210909083255-apache-reverse-proxy-setup/#determine-where-to-place-the-configuration-changes","text":"Determine the location where the files should be placed by checking the Apache configuration file for the location of the virtual host include paths. grep /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf The output should appear similar to what you see below. root@server [/]# grep /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/user1/domain.com/*.conf\" # Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/user1/domain.com/*.conf\" # Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/user2/sub1.domain.com/*.conf\" Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/user1/domain.com/*.conf\" # Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/user1/domain.com/*.conf\" # Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/user2/sub1.domain.com/*.conf\" # Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/user3/sub2.domain.com/*.conf\" # Include \"/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/user3/sub2.domain.com/*.conf\" As you can see in the resulting list above, every domain has an include path within the folders /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/ and /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/ followed by a folder matching the cPanel user name and then a folder matching the virtual host name.

Examples include VMWare's ESXi, Proxmox VE, OpenVZ, Virtuozzo, etc. Managed Hosting can facilitate the initial provisioning and setup of a Bare Metal Dedicated or Commercial Class server where the customer intends to host virtualization software. Generally speaking Type 1 Hypervisors (ESXi, Proxmox, etc) are installed using a bootable installation media. Our DC technicians have been pretty good about installing custom OS's from bootable installation media in the past when the installer is provided and any applicable licenses are provided. But, this is done as a courtesy, and these requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by our DC techs. Beyond the initial provisioning of the server and setup with an OS, Managed Hosting doesn't provide support for managing or configuring their server running virtualization software. The onus is on the customer to administer their system beyond the initial setup or obtain support for their system from a 3rd party. For a managed virtualized environment hosted solution, Flexmetal is the closest we offer for something like that. It's in Beta and is geared towards a specific type of customer so it may only be a good fit for certain types of customers. Does Managed Hosting provide support for Microsoft Server or other Microsoft products? For example: SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, etc. No, unfortunately Managed Hosting doesn't provide support for any Microsoft operating systems or server products. The exception being any Microsoft product that supports installation in a Linux environment, .NET CORE for example. If the customer wishes to use a Microsoft server product on their hardware we can provision a bare metal server with a KVM and they can install whatever Microsoft OS they would like. Note, this requires purchase of a separate KVM subscription along with their Bare Metal. The customer is completely responsible for administering their own system or obtaining support for it from a 3rd party. Does Managed Hosting provide support for .NET CORE ? Yes, Managed Hosting provides limited support for .NET in that we can install it on Linux servers. But any configuration of .NET or development of applications built in .NET would be outside of our scope of support. Shared Package limits VPS Package limits Server monitoring Maintenance ongoing upkeep of website/server over time. Do you support Docker on VPS? No, due to how Docker configures the actual Linux kernel and how our Virtuozzo nodes are setup, this is incompatible with our VPS packages and we recommend a Bare Metal server if they want to run Docker. Does MH perform email migrations? All internal email migrations are handled by WTR with the exception of Cloud VPS or Bare Metal Dedi.

Then we need to figure out the best way to order that information so that the skills building is progressive in terms of skills that build on other skills and in terms of difficulty. For anyone moving into APS and T2S/MH Linux CLI skills and best-practices should be a major part of this. We're seeing significant gaps in the skills of agents specifically in APS it seems, when it comes to Linux CLI skills and knowledge. There needs to be documentation regarding how internal tools such as scripts and oneliners should be submitted for approval and policies around how those things are processed. Right now to anyone in T1 - APS, Systems/T3 seems a bit like a black-hole. Also, Systems level agents, like myself (MH) are being told to submit scripts and tools for approval through Operation Improve, but in other channels have been told to submit them through Jira directly to T3. What's the official process? Is this documented anywhere? Since it's discouraged to disseminate files of oneliners that have been developed, this also curtails potential learning and dis-enables folks who would be able to effectively and safely use those oneliners. Oneliners may be developed multiple time by multiple different agents to solve common problems we all face, and with varying degrees of quality. Larger files that have been passed around and maintained are like a code-base that has been developed by multiple individuals over time. While not perfect, is any open-source code-base perfectly safe? Rather than completely curtailing this, why not train people in the skills they need to have better judgement around what should and shouldn't be run where. If we try to block this completely people will just work around it, which in some cases may in-fact be worse for us. We have more control over it if we train people up right not if we just try to prevent the dissemination of useful tools. If there are too many barriers to getting things approved people won't bother. Scripts and oneliners that have been in common use which have been deprecated by T3 for one reason or another should be broadcast through official channels according to an official policy. Otherwise it can and is missed if not done this way. Official channels is probably an Ack since that's the only real system we have for broadcasting any official policy changes and tracking whether or not it was Ack'd.","title":"Ideas"},{"location":"20210921200451-notes-from-andyv/","text":"Make things progressive in difficulty.

My personal feelings is that we should teach the universal way to diagnose issues that doesn't rely on internally built scripts. We should teach the general best-practices way that a sysadmin would troubleshoot a server using tools, logs and utilities, that are commonly available. This introduces good sysadmin skills and prepares the agent for tackling the types of problems that might be something they've never seen before and which aren't easily diagnosed unless they possess working understanding of how a web-server system works. After those core skills have been developed then we can introduce our internally built scripts, dedrads, etc as tools that can be used. Then these tools can be used with a foundational understanding of what type of information and diagnostics they are providing and which can be used to diagnose issues. Otherwise we've obfuscated what's actually happening under-the-hood . For example learning how to use things like sar , top , uptime , apachectl , review logs, etc. Scripts that are wrappers for things like apachectl while helpful, don't encourage learning and understanding the utilities they're based on which are critical tools one should know how to use. Beginner and Intermediate CLI proficiency is a pre-requisite to being ready to apply for APS and take the APS training. The APS pipeline should endeavor to bring agents up to speed in terms of intermediate Linux CLI skills. Significant chunks of this training are also covered by cPanel University. Why not avoid having to re-invent the wheel, and make the 1st level cPanel University cert part of the pipeline? It's a pretty foundational introduction to most of the sysadmin skills and tools that an agent should be aware of and have a working understanding of as an APS agent. Specifically as applies to a cPanel server. If this were a text adventure game, obtaining that cert is like a side quest .","title":"Initial Thoughts On The Aps Pipeline"},{"location":"20211012092623-apache-section/","text":"Source Virtual Host Configuration # Why are we teaching the /usr/local/cpanel/scripts/fix-web-vhost-configuration script? I'm sure it's useful if there's ever an issue with this, but not once in my career here have I ever had to run this script. Maybe this was a more common issue in the past, but it just doesn't seem to come up very often these days. I think a better introduction to Apache and vhosts would be to install a LAMP from scratch and perform a basic vhosts setup that serves a simple page. On a non-cPanel server of course. The /usr/local/cpanel/scripts/rebuildhttpdconf is super useful and I use it all the time, but I feel like this is really more in the scope of T1E or APS training, and not necessarily a pipeline . A pipeline program should focus on sysadmin fundamentals that are more or less operating system agnostic; i.e. don't rely on cPanel scripts, API, etc. The scripts are helpful, but it's important to understand what purpose they serve, and what they're doing under-the-hood first. Easy Apache 4 # Again, I feel like a section on EA4 is more appropriate in T1E or APS training not necessarily the pipeline. Since we should focus on skills that are more or less agnostic to the OS, a unit on the yum package manager might be more appropriate in the pipeline. In this section, we are going to look more in-depth at how to recompile Apache We're not actually recompiling the Apache binary are we? I think this isn't correct, the language could be more clear. Using check_apache # This is just an apachectl wrapper. I honestly wasn't even aware of this until more recently. DavidBi tested some of the flags for this, and it doesn't necessarily work as intended, or how you think it should. Why not teach apachectl for the pipeline instead?

A pipeline program should focus on sysadmin fundamentals that are more or less operating system agnostic; i.e. don't rely on cPanel scripts, API, etc. The scripts are helpful, but it's important to understand what purpose they serve, and what they're doing under-the-hood first.","title":"Virtual Host Configuration"},{"location":"20211012092623-apache-section/#easy-apache-4","text":"Again, I feel like a section on EA4 is more appropriate in T1E or APS training not necessarily the pipeline.

But from the standpoint of maintaining a pipeline, videos are difficult to change once they're in place. Re-editing, re-shooting, or re-creating the video would be time-consuming. Since we're busy sysadmins, let's be realistic, maintaining static assets like these videos and keeping them up-to-date simply wouldn't happen. Much like a docs as code philosphy, maintaining a pipeline in a text-based format would allow for us to use a version control system like git , and use a git-based work-flow like pull-requests to submit updates or changes, or suggest improvements. This is maintainable in the long-term. Video assets while helpful are static, don't allow for version control, and if they become out of date, the only recourse is to just re-create them. Videos may be more appropriate for official APS training since they would be maintained by the training dept. But if the pipeline is a more informal program which is maintained by T2S/MH/T3, etc, then it needs to be easy for us to maintain. We already use git to maintain our code.

It's assumed that if you're reading this, that you're a self-starter, and able to fill in the gaps by doing your own research (i.e. google-fu) if something doesn't make sense. This is a roadmap not an exhaustive tutorial. Other authors and teachers have done a much better job of creating learning materials and tutorials than I could ever do myself. Just like with most open source software I'm going to borrow heavily from things that have been built by people much more capable and experienced than myself. This is the open source way after all. This is curated list of what I consider to be essential skills along with the best free resources available to learn those skills. This collection is inspired by guide's like the Teach Yourself Computer Science and Open Source Society University . The primary difference being this is intended to provide a foundation for the aspiring Linux System Administrator. While there's quite a bit of overlap between Computer Science and System Administration, there are skills and fundamentals that seem to be the foundation for competency in IT and System Administration. Linux CLI Fundamentals # Gold-standard tutorial: Command Line Crash Course By Zed Shaw Also-good, is Learning the Shell Best in class, video lecture: The Missing Semester: Course Overview + the Shell Learn cPanel Basics # This section is web hosting centric. If you're not looking to work in web hosting, feel free to skip this section. It's hard to beat the official cPanel university certifications for learning the fundamentals of their platform. If you haven't already I recommend registering an account at cPanel University . Complete the cPanel Professional Certification (CPP) It helps if you have access to a cPanel in order to try out the things in cPanel. If you don't already have access to cPanel, this author recommends finding a budget host (there are some for as little as $1/mo) and getting a 1 month subscription to start. It's a few bucks to further your education. Install a WordPress site # This skill is web hosting centric.

Best overall tutorial: How to Install WordPress Concepts, Software, and Protocol fundamentals # Port A port is a number. It's the port that a server uses to send/receive requests. It's part of the Internet Protocol. Whenever your computer connects to a server for any reason, it does so through an open port on that server. FTP - File Transfer Protocol Used to transfer files. It's in the name. Uses port 21 SSH - Secure Shell Uses an encrypted tunnel to provide a secure connection to a remote terminal (CLI) Uses port 22 HTTP - Hyper-text Transfer Protocol Most of the web uses HTTP (or HTTPS). If you're reading this in a browser it's being served using HTTP by a web server. Uses port 80 HTTPS - Hyper-text Transfer Protocol Security This is the secure version of HTTP and runs on a different port number.u Anytime you see that insecure warning in your browser it's usually because the site you visited isn't sing HTTPS and is therefore insecure. HTTPS uses an SSL Certificate to create an encrypted connection to the web server that's running the website you visited. Uses port 443 Apache Web Server # Apache is the most commonly used free open source web server in use on the internet. Most servers that host websites run Apache. This is the software that serves web-pages over the HTTP and HTTPS protocols (ports 80 and 443 respectively). Linux # Linux is an operating system. It's like Windows, MacOS, or Android. It's the most common operating system in use on servers. It's free and open source (FOSS) meaning anyone can download, install it, and use it however they see fit. You can custom compile the Linux Kernel to your own needs if you want. Most Linux operating systems are what's known as a distribution which is a bundle or package of software that ships with the Linux Kernal, usually containing an installer, and a few other nice-to-haves. In the web hosting space CentOS is a commonly used Linux Distribution that's used for web servers. The main reason being it's reputation for long-term stability. It's the free open source (unlicensed) version of RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that's known for it's stability and is backed by the support that RedHat offers. Another common Linux Distribution that's often used for web-hosting servers and which you may have heard of is Ubuntu Server . Recommended Learning # [ ] Download a common FTP client for your OS whether that's Windows or MacOS and figure out how to connect to an FTP server with it. [ ] Download an SSH client and connect to a Linux server using SSH Optional # [ ] Find a Linux Distribution that you like and if you have old hardware laying around, figure out how to install it and run it.

Markdown is a widely supported syntax for authoring text-based notes. It's relatively future proof in that there's likely to be parsers and renderers available for it for quite some time. The Markdown Guide Official Spec: Markdown A note-taking system that uses a collection of simple text files (i.e. Markdown files) is future proof in that you control your data. It's not tied to some proprietary platform that may not still exist in 15-20 years. Roam Research (see link above) is an example of this kind of vendor lock-in.","title":"Learn Markdown (Optional)"},{"location":"20220104135452-resume/","text":"Resume # Resume Writing # My favorite resource on how to write a resume: https://rockportinstitute.com/resources/how-to-write-a-masterpiece-of-a-resume/ Hire a professional: https://www.topresume.com Recommended by Nick Powell https://hbr.org/2014/12/how-to-write-a-resume-that-stands-out","title":"Resume"},{"location":"20220104135452-resume/#resume","text":"","title":"Resume"},{"location":"20220104135452-resume/#resume-writing","text":"My favorite resource on how to write a resume: https://rockportinstitute.com/resources/how-to-write-a-masterpiece-of-a-resume/ Hire a professional: https://www.topresume.com Recommended by Nick Powell https://hbr.org/2014/12/how-to-write-a-resume-that-stands-out","title":"Resume Writing"},{"location":"20220105072936-pandoc/","text":"Overview # If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife.

See dependency req's: https://www.sellacious.com/documentation-v2#/learn/basics/system-requirements (The version of pdo_sqlite that currently ships with ea-php74 is 3.7.17 ) In this case we have a few options. The most up-to-date rpm's available are from the remi repo : http://mirror.bebout.net/remi/enterprise/7/php74/x86_64/repoview/php.html PHP 7.4 from remi repo # We can provision the remi repo with: yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm Source In this particular case we probably also need to enable the remi-php74 repo with: yum-config-manager --enable remi-php74 But if we try to install any of the php74 packages from that repo on a cPanel server we'll encounter no package available errors.

Aphorisms on IT, problem solving, and related. On project manglement # The scope is the project. Or, do you even know what your project is, if you haven't scoped it? Failure to scope your project adequately will result in failure to deliver said project. A poorly defined scope or project description that's chock-full of buzzwords is vague enough as to be virtually useless (i.e. limitless or without scope ). There's no way to complete a project with no clearly defined scope because there's no way to reasonable be able to say when it's \"done.\" Define the scope and you've defined the project. Said in other words, if you don't have a clearly defined scope what you have is an \"idea\" not a project. This is also why many people have a \"million dollar idea\" but they need a \"technical co-founder\" to bring it to fruition. They have failed to define a scope and therefore a project. Adequately scoping a project requires technical knowledge and domain experience, and the effort involved shouldn't be taken lightly. This may in fact be more than half the battle when it comes to completing a project. Non-technical PM's who are also poor managers are worse than no manager at all when it comes to technical projects. There I said it. But also, if you're not technical and you're also not a good manager, what business do you have managing a technical project? Non-technical PM's who are also poor managers are worse than no manager at all. Non-technical PM's who are good managers are slightly better than no manager at all as they can act as a \"buffer\" between the customer and the IT professional and perform a \"diplomatic function\". (see runaway problem cascades, below). Best is a PM who's both technical and possesses adequate people skills to interface with the customer. This is understandably rare and worth every penny (although C-levels rarely seem to see it this way). It's difficult to apply quality control to a project without a technical PM. Projects must be rooted in \"reality\" # I feel like this shouldn't need to be said, but experience dictates otherwise... Projects must obey the physical laws of the universe. Projects must be rooted in reality This means first and foremost obeying the physical laws of the universe. This includes the laws of thermodynamics and therefore no project is immune to entropy . Therefore, bugs are inevitable. If bugs could be predicted and mitigated that would mean time-travel is possible, and this breaks all of the known laws of the universe! Customers who expect this, are dilusional and need to be \"educated\" (see below). Complexity is the devil and is best avoided if at all possible. Unfortunately, some complexity is necessary. Efforts to reduce complexity and provide simple clear and ledgible solutions is honorable and deserves more recognition than it seems to get. The difficulty in producing a simple universal solution to a class of problems should not be underestimated. Depending on how universal the solution, this can literally be a \"work of genius.\" Einsteins general theory of relativity is an example of a simple solution to a universal class of problems that was literally a work of genius. Inalienable Truths # Something must serve as the single source of truth. Always. It doesn't necessarily matter what it is, but it must exist. Everything else should be treated as \"fiction\". If it's not a ticket, it's not getting done. Just because it's a ticket doesn't mean that it's a problem that needs to be solved. (See law of parsimony below) Not solving a problem can be a valid solution. It's always worth consideration. Time spent in meetings is inversely correlated with productivity. Computers do everything you tell them to exactly as they're told, nothing more nothing less. Do things the \"right\" way the first time. There's usually a \"right\" way to do something, or at least a \"more right\" way to do something. It's many orders of magnitude easier and faster to do something right the first time than it is to try to fix it later (if it's even possible to fix it later). Alongside lack of documentation this may be the 2nd most abundant reason for \"technical debt\". DNS is almost always the issue. Most developers and software admins don't truly understand DNS. Any developer who understands DNS and networking is actually \"DevOps\" despite what their title might say. Human-centered \"issues\" # Communication overhead grows exponentially in relation to the number of people on a team. There's a point beyond which no useful production occurs beyond maintaining the status quo. If combined with mis-management it's in-fact possible to move backwards on a project under certain circumstances. Knowledge work is non-linear and hours in doesn't equal hours out in terms of production. At the extreme end of performance knowledge work is more like being an athlete. Top chess grandmasters is a case in point. Productivity obey's the pareto principle in that 80% of the work is being done by 20% of the workers. This an immutable law of the universe. You might as well use the 80% of your work-force to do menial tasks to free up your top 20% of performers to do their best work. Nobody manages their work this way though, because \"fairness\" and \"equality\" usually plays a part. Optimizing for productivity above all else would look a lot different. Attitude is more than half the battle. Sub-class of humans known as \"customers\" # Customers are often wrong and if not handled carefully may introduce more technical debt, burry techs in \"non-problems\", or result in more communication overhead than can be reasonably managed by the IT resources available. If left completely unchecked this could easily result in a runaway problem cascade that can't be resolved with the IT-resources available in the known universe. Educating the customer must be achieved \"diplomatically\" or the IT professional may find themselves saddled with \"financial\" problems instead of our preferred \"technical\" ones. There exists space in a venn-diagram of customer \"asks\" and \"solvable problems\" that's neither the \"most right\" solution or impossible. This is a balance that must be delicately maintained. (see runaway problem cascade above) On the unreasonable usefulness of documentation # Understanding undocumented systems is an art, but more importantly a \"science.\" Doing \"science\" as an IT professional is not necessarily a good thing. If it's not documented somewhere, \"science\" must be conducted to understand the system through rigorous positing of hypothesis and developing models (i.e. theories) via testing, and observation. Only once concrete evidence is obtained through observational tools and a useful model developed (i.e. theory) can the system be reliably fixed when it inevitably breaks. This is an arduous, time-consuming, and inefficient process. It's often many orders of magnitude less-effort to rebuild the system, documenting as you go, than it is to try to understand an undocumented system that already exists. This is the origins of most \"technical debt.\" Lack of documentation is probably the single greatest source of \"technical debt\" beyond poor design or development choices. Documentation is a moral obligation to your fellow IT professionals. It's unequivocally ethically \"good\" to write documentation and worse than mere laziness but for all intents and purposes \"evil\" to fail to produce adequate documentation alongside delivery of any sort of developed system, body of work, coded project, or other necessarily complex system. Not only will future techs thank you, but your future self will thank you as well. It's irrational to assume your memory is as good as you think it is and that you won't refer to your own carefully crafted docs 6-months from now. Visual aids such as lovingly crafted network diagrams are a love-letter to future sysadmins. This is the art of documentation. It's intrinsically good to produce this form of documentation even if nobody ever see's it other than you. Failure to document is failure to embue your thing with enough evolutionary relevance to survive the first iteration of said thing. It will cease to exist beyond it's first iteration since it will be too difficult to understand and it will instead be replaced by a newer heartier version of the thing. The only exceptions are a thing that's so business useful it's worth infusing inordinate amounts of resources (money) to \"life-support\" said thing, but even these systems eventually are overcome. Getting to the \"root\" of the problem # Context is everything. Problems don't exist outside of the context they live in. Failure to provide context is failure to provide a problem rooted in reality. Problems not rooted in reality are fictitious and not real problems. (See laws of physics above) A well-defined problem is a solvable problem. You can't solve the problem before defining the problem in concrete terms. If you can't define the problem in concrete terms you don't understand enough about the system to define it. If you don't understand the system, either read the docs or if those don't exist, do more \"science\" (see above) to understand the problem space. Apprenticeship from a wizard is the only \"short-cut\" to RTFM and/or doing \"science\". But it's not a substitute for those two things and should be used sparingly. Accurately defining the problem is more than half the battle. Sometimes if you try to formulate your problem in such a way that you can describe it to someone else you'll solve your own problem. This is because you've only now \"defined your problem in concrete terms\" (see above). Reaching out to others and formulating your problem is a valid problem solving method. Problems are only truly resolved from at the root. Solve root issues not symptoms . Solving symptoms is little better than a \"bandaid\" in most cases, and in some cases creates more \"problems\" to be solved. The only right solution is solving the root issue. QED The law of parsimony and problem solving. # The simplest solution is almost always the best solution. The absolute simplest solution is no solution at all. For this reason, it's worth putting serious thought into if your thing should exist at all. After all, existence creates problems that then need to be solved. Entropy dictates this. On the observability of problems # AKA quantum problems Some problems are in a special class of problems analagous to quantum particles in that observation of the problem affects the problem itself. You can know either a particle's position or velocity, but not both. Observation of the problem will change the nature of the problem. The good news is the solution is usually static even if observations are subject to change. The wise sysadmin knows this, and is thus unsurprised when different observational tools produce different results for the same problems. Only through testing and continued observation can the problem space converge towards a \"limit.\" Using the calculus analogy most problems converge , but some classes of problems (i.e. impossible problems) diverge . Experience is required to identify divergent probems, and mastery required to be able to set aside such problems. Don't go looking for problems. In a similar fashion, some problems don't exist until they are observed. These are the \"if a tree falls in the forest but no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?\" class of problems. For this reason it's important to make sure that monitoring and alerting tools are calibrated effectively such that you're not creating a limitless supply of \"problems\" for yourself and your team. Problems are literally infinite if you look hard enough, but the solution space is for all practical purposes finite. Triage problems ruthlessly or forever be chasing the receding horizon that is your problem set. Triaging problems is essential. Some problems are not really problems in that the system is robust enough to survive uncritical \"issues\", in many cases indefinitely. Given this, are they really problems? Other problems kill the host and should be treated with utmost urgency. Most problems are somewhere in-between these two extremes. Premature optimization # Performance optimization is a class of problems that may be both uncritical or critical depending on the context. At some point performance optimization becomes \"yak shaving\" and is best avoided. Fear of failure # Backups are only as valuable as the regular testing and documentation of your disaster recovery solution. Without testing, your backup solution is little more than worthless. HA is only as good as it's implementation and in practice only as good as the sysadmins maintaining it. Overly complex or difficult to maintain HA systems may in fact be less reliable and result in more downtime in practice than a single monolithic system. Think carefully before introducing this level of complexity to your system. HA is by no means a silver-bullet and should be implemented sparingly. An undocumented HA solution may as well not exist. Anybody who asks for HA as a solution to the class of \"all problems resulting in downtime\" doesn't truly understand HA. (See educating the customer above) DR tests don't always go according to plan, that's why they're called DR \"tests\". If a customer gets upset when a DR test doesn't go according to plan they need to be \"educated\" (see human problems above). Theory of knowledge (aka learning) # If don't truly \"know\" something until you can describe it in a way that a 5 year old can understand. You don't really understand something until you can build something with it. Learning vs. \"Education\" # There's no substitute for experience. You can't learn how to be a developer/sysadmin/devops in a 12-week bootcamp, despite marketing to the contrary. You can, however, get a job after, and then \"learn\" those things. Formal education in computer science is weakly correlated with future success in the field, if it's correlated at all. It could be argued that IT is really more of an \"apprenticeship\" and for most practical purposes it's best approached with \"hands-on\" learning. Certs are resume builders. IT certificates are little better than bullet points on a resume that get your foot in the door with recruiters. Most IT professionals could care less and the proof is the the pudding so-to-speak. It's possible to study for the test and not really understand a lot of what you \"learned.\" It's even more common to cram for the test and forget 90% of what you learned.The only exception is skills learned in a lab that closely approximates real-life scenarios. We only care about the skills you can demonstrate and being able to solve real problems in the field. Willingness to learn, attitude, and analytical thinking skills are far more important than any certification. It's your approach to a problem that's unfamiliar to you that's much more important than whether or not you get the right answer at least as far as interviewing is concerned. How to learn # Learn by doing is best. Portfolio projects are a much better indicator of true skills and knowledge. Project-based learning that solves real-world problems is the best way to learn IT skills. The best lab for the IT professional is the homelab. The monetary investment in a homelab is completely dwarfed by future salary compensation. In the long-term it's a negligible expense. If you're not interested in building a homelab and learning in your off-hours, seriously reconsider whether or not this is the right field for you. It's difficult to progress (at least at first) without a natural affinity for learning and being driven by curiosity. Later in your career you may be able to afford to \"rest on your laurels\" and coast in your career. But expect to put a significant amount of free-time towards learning and skills acquisition your first few years.

Or, do you even know what your project is, if you haven't scoped it? Failure to scope your project adequately will result in failure to deliver said project. A poorly defined scope or project description that's chock-full of buzzwords is vague enough as to be virtually useless (i.e. limitless or without scope ). There's no way to complete a project with no clearly defined scope because there's no way to reasonable be able to say when it's \"done.\" Define the scope and you've defined the project. Said in other words, if you don't have a clearly defined scope what you have is an \"idea\" not a project. This is also why many people have a \"million dollar idea\" but they need a \"technical co-founder\" to bring it to fruition. They have failed to define a scope and therefore a project. Adequately scoping a project requires technical knowledge and domain experience, and the effort involved shouldn't be taken lightly. This may in fact be more than half the battle when it comes to completing a project. Non-technical PM's who are also poor managers are worse than no manager at all when it comes to technical projects. There I said it. But also, if you're not technical and you're also not a good manager, what business do you have managing a technical project? Non-technical PM's who are also poor managers are worse than no manager at all. Non-technical PM's who are good managers are slightly better than no manager at all as they can act as a \"buffer\" between the customer and the IT professional and perform a \"diplomatic function\". (see runaway problem cascades, below). Best is a PM who's both technical and possesses adequate people skills to interface with the customer. This is understandably rare and worth every penny (although C-levels rarely seem to see it this way). It's difficult to apply quality control to a project without a technical PM.","title":"On project manglement"},{"location":"20220926182945-IT-aphorisms/#projects-must-be-rooted-in-reality","text":"I feel like this shouldn't need to be said, but experience dictates otherwise... Projects must obey the physical laws of the universe. Projects must be rooted in reality This means first and foremost obeying the physical laws of the universe. This includes the laws of thermodynamics and therefore no project is immune to entropy . Therefore, bugs are inevitable. If bugs could be predicted and mitigated that would mean time-travel is possible, and this breaks all of the known laws of the universe! Customers who expect this, are dilusional and need to be \"educated\" (see below). Complexity is the devil and is best avoided if at all possible. Unfortunately, some complexity is necessary. Efforts to reduce complexity and provide simple clear and ledgible solutions is honorable and deserves more recognition than it seems to get. The difficulty in producing a simple universal solution to a class of problems should not be underestimated. Depending on how universal the solution, this can literally be a \"work of genius.\" Einsteins general theory of relativity is an example of a simple solution to a universal class of problems that was literally a work of genius.","title":"Projects must be rooted in \"reality\""},{"location":"20220926182945-IT-aphorisms/#inalienable-truths","text":"Something must serve as the single source of truth.

Time spent in meetings is inversely correlated with productivity. Computers do everything you tell them to exactly as they're told, nothing more nothing less. Do things the \"right\" way the first time. There's usually a \"right\" way to do something, or at least a \"more right\" way to do something. It's many orders of magnitude easier and faster to do something right the first time than it is to try to fix it later (if it's even possible to fix it later). Alongside lack of documentation this may be the 2nd most abundant reason for \"technical debt\". DNS is almost always the issue. Most developers and software admins don't truly understand DNS.

Top chess grandmasters is a case in point. Productivity obey's the pareto principle in that 80% of the work is being done by 20% of the workers. This an immutable law of the universe. You might as well use the 80% of your work-force to do menial tasks to free up your top 20% of performers to do their best work.

TL;DR # It's 2am and you're called in for a P1, what commands should I run to triage a Linux server? ping <IP or hostname> - Check if a server is up and is reachable uptime - Server uptime and CPU load averages. free -h - Memory and swap utilization. 0 mem available = bad htop & top - Realtime process diagnostics, \"top\" process list, cpu loadavg, mem utilization, etc sudo dmesg | tail - Print the last 10 kernel messages, if something is wrong the kernel will usually complain about it. df -h - Disk usage. If any disk is at 100% or if this hangs there are storage problems nslookup <domain or hostname> - Check if you can resolve a domain or hostname A few other useful commands: man <command> - Print manpage (i.e. manual) for a command sudo <command> - Run a command as root cat , head , tail , and less , - Reading files (see below for details) grep 'string' <file> - Search a file for a 'string' . <command> | <command> - \"Pipe\" output of a command to another command Useful files: /var/log/messages - Kernel and services will log errors here. sudo less or sudo grep this file to look for errors. /etc/hosts - Often used to override DNS which can cause problems... cat this file to see them. Compare what's in here to the output of nslookup or ping . /etc/fstab - Drive mount configuration. If dmesg shows NFS or CIFS errors, cat this file to show network mounts. /proc/cpuinfo - CPU information. lscpu or grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l to show number of CPUs. Linux CLI Fundamentals # This guide assumes you've already acquired some Linux CLI fundamentals. Commands like ls , pwd , cd , etc. should be commands you're already familiar with. But, if not, no worries, it's not hard to acquire some basic CLI fundamentals. Others have done a much better job of covering this topic, so I won't bother to do that here. Instead I've provided the following suggested resources for learning Linux CLI basics. Gold-standard tutorial: Command Line Crash Course by Zed Shaw Also-good, is Learning the Shell Best in class, video lecture (MIT): The Missing Semester: Course Overview + the Shell Basic Linux Troubleshooting # CLI Options # For a quick refresher on options available for any particular command, and for manpage (i.e. manual ) use the man command. For example: man free Performance Monitoring # Analyzing CPU Load # List server uptime and 1, 5 and 15 minute CPU load averages with the uptime command. This is useful for diagnosing issues related to server load, latency, or if applications are unresponsive. For example: ~ # uptime 20:53pm up 7 days 11:05, 1 user, load average: 19.31, 18.21, 12.10 High load averages aren't always an indicator of a problem. It's important to compare the load average with the number of CPUs available. The /proc/cpuinfo file shows all kinds of information about the CPUs on a server including how many there are. To determine the number of CPUs on a machine run the following: grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l Using the same server from the example above we get: ~ # grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l 32 This searches the cpuinfo file for the string 'processor' and then uses wc (word count) to count how many lines of output there are. If you pipe these two commands together with a | that gives you the number of CPUs available on that machine, in this case that's 32. Or in most cases it's probably easiest to just run lscpu : ~ # lscpu Architecture: x86_64 CPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit Byte Order: Little Endian Address sizes: 46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual CPU(s): 32 ... NOTE: lscpu isn't always available. A general rule of thumb is there's a 1:1 ratio between load average and number of CPUs. Basically if load average is more than the number of CPU's it means load is over 100% and warrants further investigation. The other thing to be on the lookout for here is if load average is trending upwards between 15, 5 and 1 minute load averages (reading from right to left). Memory utilization # To show memory and swap utilization on a server run the free command. By default it will output memory utilization statistics in bytes, but with the -h option it will display memory utilization in human readable format: ~ # free -h total used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 15Gi 6.0Gi 4.3Gi 1.3Gi 6.9Gi 9.5Gi Swap: 2.0Gi 1.0Mi 2.0Gi Pay attention to the free column, when free memory is 0 that's often cause for concern. Especially if swap usage is high. It's important to keep in mind that the Linux kernel treats free memory as wasted memory and it will try to cache as much in memory as possible. So while the example above only shows 1.2G of memory free out of a total of 204G, this is not really cause for alarm. Especially since virtually no swap is being used. View top processes in realtime # With the top and htop (human readable top), you can view top processes as well as other system stats such as load average, memory utilization, etc all displayed in realtime. htop example Note that htop is easier to read, but isn't installed by default so it's not always available. In those cases, just use top . Things to look for are high CPU utilization, high memory utilization, and the processes that seem to be consuming the most CPU and MEM.

Processes # You can list running processes with the ps utility, and most commonly this command is ran with following options: ps aux . If you've identified a process that seems to be a problem from top or htop you can search for it with something like the following: ps aux | grep <search_string> In this example we search for a specific PID 4729 identified previously during our troubleshooting: swiglsb2db:~ # ps aux | grep [4]729 db2pse 4729 119 57.3 151050000 123005184 ?

Only kill processes if you know what it is and know it's safe to do so. When in doubt reach out to a sysadmin. A note about listeners # Listeners are processes that are \"listening\" for connections. A common example of an application that \"listens\" for connections and then serves something to those connections is a webserver. You can list processes \"listening\" for TCP and UDP connections with netstat . It's common to run netstat with the following options, for example: swiglsb2db:~ # netstat -tulpn Active Internet connections (only servers) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:22 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 2805/sshd tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:34333 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN - tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:5918 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 4729/db2sysc 0 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:1128 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 2832/sapstartsrv tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:1129 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 2832/sapstartsrv tcp 0 0 :::7820 :::* LISTEN 1471/node_exporter tcp 0 0 :::33933 :::* LISTEN - tcp 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN 2805/sshd udp 4608 0 0.0.0.0:68 0.0.0.0:* 1496/wickedd-dhcp4 udp 0 0 10.110.1.103:123 0.0.0.0:* 2531/ntpd udp 0 0 127.0.0.1:123 0.0.0.0:* 2531/ntpd udp 0 0 0.0.0.0:123 0.0.0.0:* 2531/ntpd udp 0 0 fe80::4001:aff:fe6e:123 :::* 2531/ntpd udp 0 0 ::1:123 :::* 2531/ntpd udp 0 0 :::123 :::* 2531/ntpd This can be useful for determining if an application is up or not. For example, on most Linux servers you'll often see sshd which is the SSH server. This listens on port 22 by default. If you know what port your application is supposed to be listening on and you don't see it here, that could indicate there's a problem. If it's an SAP application, you can notify a Basis admin and have them look into it. For anything else, you'll probably be reaching out to a sysadmin at this point. Troubleshooting services # Linux uses an application called systemd to manage what are called \"services\". Systemd is rather complex and is what Linux uses to bootstrap itself to a running system. We don't need to get into all of that here. Mostly what you would need to do with systemd is check the status of a service and attempt to start the service if it's \"failed.\" Systemd uses the systemctl (system control) utility to manage services. Check status of a service: sudo systemctl status <service> Start a service: sudo systemctl start <service> In this example we've identified a potential issue with one of our monitoring agents sap_host_exporter . We check the status and find out it's in a \"failed\" state and attempt to start it. Status check: akraker@amyelprd00:~> sudo systemctl status sap_host_exporter \u25cf sap_host_exporter.service - SAP Host (NetWeaver) Exporter Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/sap_host_exporter.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Thu 2022-08-04 00:41:57 PDT; 6h ago Attempt to start the service: akraker@amyelprd00:~> sudo systemctl start sap_host_exporter Check if starting it was successful: akraker@amyelprd00:~> sudo systemctl status sap_host_exporter \u25cf sap_host_exporter.service - SAP Host (NetWeaver) Exporter Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/sap_host_exporter.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-08-04 06:51:33 PDT; 3s ago ... In this example it looks like we were successful in starting the sap_host_exporter . Reading and Searching Files # less # less <file> - Read a file using a pager Here's an example running less /var/log/messages . This is a common way to review log entries from the kernel and for services. less example cat # cat file - Print the contents a file to your terminal A common example were this might be used is to view the /etc/hosts file: swiglsb2db:~ # cat /etc/hosts # # hosts This file describes a number of hostname-to-address # mappings for the TCP/IP subsystem.

This is useful for diagnosing issues related to server load, latency, or if applications are unresponsive. For example: ~ # uptime 20:53pm up 7 days 11:05, 1 user, load average: 19.31, 18.21, 12.10 High load averages aren't always an indicator of a problem. It's important to compare the load average with the number of CPUs available. The /proc/cpuinfo file shows all kinds of information about the CPUs on a server including how many there are. To determine the number of CPUs on a machine run the following: grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l Using the same server from the example above we get: ~ # grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l 32 This searches the cpuinfo file for the string 'processor' and then uses wc (word count) to count how many lines of output there are. If you pipe these two commands together with a | that gives you the number of CPUs available on that machine, in this case that's 32. Or in most cases it's probably easiest to just run lscpu : ~ # lscpu Architecture: x86_64 CPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit Byte Order: Little Endian Address sizes: 46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual CPU(s): 32 ... NOTE: lscpu isn't always available. A general rule of thumb is there's a 1:1 ratio between load average and number of CPUs. Basically if load average is more than the number of CPU's it means load is over 100% and warrants further investigation. The other thing to be on the lookout for here is if load average is trending upwards between 15, 5 and 1 minute load averages (reading from right to left).","title":"Analyzing CPU Load"},{"location":"20230904163600-linux-ts-non-sa/#memory-utilization","text":"To show memory and swap utilization on a server run the free command.
